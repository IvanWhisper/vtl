package parser

// A set of constants for precedence-based expression parsing.
// Non-operators have lowest precedence, followed by operators
// starting with precedence 1 up to unary operators. The highest
// precedence serves as "catch-all" precedence for selector,
// indexing, and other operator and delimiter tokens.
//
const (
	LowestPrec  = 0 // non-operators
	UnaryPrec   = 6
	HighestPrec = 7
